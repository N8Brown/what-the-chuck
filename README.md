# WHAT-THE-CHUCK

If you think you know about Chuck Norris, think again.

This web application utilizes the [Chuck Norris Jokes API](https://api.chucknorris.io/) to provide users with fun random "facts" about the man, the myth, the beard...Chuch Norris.

The app features a Chuck Norris cartoon character that will randomly perform one of three animations when clicked on to either chop, slap, or flying back-flip kick the text box to call for a new random Chuck Norris fact.

The purpose of this project was to practice API integration for making and processing requests. Additionally, this project served as means by which to work with and create CSS animations from scratch. The final product is also mobile responsive and styled to be viewed and used across multiple devices.
